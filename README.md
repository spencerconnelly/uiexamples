Hello,

I added several folders that show projects that have a lot of the skills you are looking for. 

In the games folder are several Unity games I created.

The Web folder contains several web applications I have been working on building up to my website that is currently in the 
early stages of development. 

The Python folder are a few projects my previous employer gave me the OK to share.  They are several laboratory scripts I
created in order to display and input information into the factory computers.  The scripts are still being used today.

I hope you enjoy!
